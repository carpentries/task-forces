# Recommendation for a Flexible, Credit-Based Membership Model with Strategic Discounts, Community Resources, and Comprehensive Success Metrics

The following recommendations aim to help The Carpentries develop a customisable, credit-based membership model aligned with our mission to foster broad community engagement, support volunteer contributions, and ensure sustainable revenue generation. This approach will introduce flexible membership tiers and resources tailored to diverse organisational and individual needs, prioritising accessibility and long-term financial sustainability for The Carpentries as a non-profit organisation.

## Recommendation 1: Rename the Membership Program to Reflect Commitment and Partnership
Rebrand the "Membership" program to emphasise the collaborative commitment and active partnership between The Carpentries and participating organisations. Partner Organisations benefit from priority access to Instructor Training, capacity-building guidance, and a network of local Instructors who run impactful workshops at reduced costs. This approach should highlight the value of the partnership, which supports sustainable lesson development, Instructors, and a shared global effort in lesson creation on essential open-source topics.

## Recommendation 2: Flexible Credit Packages with Mix-and-Match Options
Offer customisable credit packages that enable members to tailor benefits to their evolving needs. Providing flexibility to select benefits (e.g., Instructor Training seats, Collaborative Lesson Development Training seats) allows organisations to align benefits with their current priorities. Introduce varied credit tiers to accommodate organisations at different levels—from introductory to comprehensive options for long-standing or high-engagement organisations.

## Recommendation 3: Service Options for Individuals and Institutions
Introduce service options for individuals and institutions. Provide a range of services —some available for free, others as a la carte or optional add-ons within the new model. This layered access structure encourages broad community participation and supports those seeking various services, such as workshop access outside of institutional membership. Examples of service options include:

- Individual seats for core Carpentries training programs.  
- Members-only skill-up sessions on topics like GitHub, community building, and collaboration.
- Advanced training modules on online teaching, project-based learning, and community equity.
- Consulting on online meetings, workflows, remote project management, and strategies for recruiting and retaining diverse community members.
- Expert advice on creating and implementing a Code of Conduct (CoC).
- Information technology guidance for tools like Google Workspace and Zapier automation.
- Limited-edition Carpentries pins (e.g., from CarpentryCon 2018).

## Recommendation 4: Tiered Discount Structure for Loyalty and Onboarding
Implement referral discounts where referring and referred organisations receive savings, fostering community growth. Encourage loyalty by providing discounts for multi-year (2-3) commitments, with added benefits like professional development opportunities for longer-term member organisations. For new members, offer a first-year discount with incentives for second-year renewal to support onboarding and sustained engagement.

## Recommendation 5: Pricing for Revenue Generation and Accessibility
Set a competitive, income-tiered pricing model tailored to ensure The Carpentries' financial sustainability while promoting equitable access. Structure fees to cover essential operational costs, including staff salaries and benefits, infrastructure upkeep, program growth, and enhanced support for community initiatives. Engage a professional to develop this pricing framework, aligning it with market rates, World Bank income classifications, and the growth objectives established by The Carpentries Board of Directors.

## Recommendation 6: Commitment Packages with Added Benefits
Develop a comprehensive 'Unlimited' package for high-engagement member organisations seeking full-service access, promoting deeper integration with The Carpentries. For multi-year institutions offer incremental benefits such as exclusive professional development, specialised services, and additional credits, providing substantial added value for long-term commitments.
