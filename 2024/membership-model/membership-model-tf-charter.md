# Problem Statement
The Carpentries has been operating a Membership model to empower institutions and individuals to build capacity in computational skills. In 2019, a Member organisation survey revealed critical insights into the primary goals and aspirations of Carpentries members, numbering 55 at the time. The data highlighted key objectives such as training Instructors, fostering local communities around computational training, supporting Carpentries' sustainability, and building capacity for self-organized workshops. However, five years later, despite maintaining relevance, The Carpentries has observed fluctuations in Membership renewal rates and utilization of benefits.

Moreover, Members have expressed evolving needs and desires, seeking resources to enhance community sustainability, inclusion of curriculum development training, and support for workshop attendees post-training. Additionally, there's a growing interest in initiatives that foster inclusivity, such as recruiting and supporting underrepresented groups, facilitating cross-cultural collaborations, and engaging under-resourced communities.

In response to these findings and ongoing discussions at the 2024 Board of Directors retreat, there's a pressing need to reassess The Carpentries' membership model. Key questions have been raised regarding aligning services with members' needs, defining success, and balancing revenue generation and community engagement. Moreover, recommendations have been proposed to introduce Collaborative Lesson Development  Training, ensure a non-transactional model, expand benefits, and align Membership offerings with The Carpentries' core values.

# Objective
This task force aims to revamp The Carpentries' Membership model by convening stakeholders to explore the following questions:
- Are the current Membership offerings aligned with the evolving needs of Carpentries Member organizations?
- How can success be defined in the context of the Carpentries Membership model, balancing revenue generation and community engagement?
- What measures can prevent a transactional relationship with members while ensuring sustainability?
- How can membership benefits be expanded and enhanced to reflect The Carpentries' values and mission better?
- What pricing structure best suits the organisation's operational costs and financial goals while emphasizing equity?
- Which membership model system, such as a credit-based system, optimally complements our existing team's technical infrastructure and workflows?
