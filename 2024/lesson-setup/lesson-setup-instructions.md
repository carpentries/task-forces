# Task Force Charter: Lesson Setup Instructions Task Force

Approval date: 14 August 2024
Status: active
Completion date: TBD

## Description/Problem Statement
Most Carpentries lessons require some technical setup before they can be followed (software installation, data downloads, etc). 
Lesson websites include this information in a _Setup_ section of their homepage, often linking out to a central set of instructions maintained in [the template repository for workshop websites](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template/).
The instructions we provide on what software to install for lessons and how has remained largely unchanged for several years. 
However, developments including the release of Windows Subsystem Linux and a change in Anaconda's Terms of Service for their Python distribution have preciptated the need for lesson setup instructions to be reviewed.

## Objectives/Purpose
This task force will review existing setup instructions for Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry lessons and decide where and how these instructions should be updated.
The members will consider:

1. The software that should be installed for lessons teaching the following (including the way that software is distributed/packaged):
    - Bash
    - Git
    - Python
    - R
3. How changes to the recommended software/setup instructions for a lesson could impact the content of the lesson itself.

Wherever possible, the task force will aim to produce a single set of installation instructions for a given software (e.g. Python, Git) that can be re-used across all DC, LC, and SWC lessons that teach that software.

## Deliverables

1. A rubric to evaluate options for software distributions/methods of installation, reflecting [The Carpentries core values](https://carpentries.org/values/) and the principles set out in [the Instructor Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).
2. A set of recommendations for software/distributions to be used in lesson setup instructions, based on an assessment against the rubric described in 1, above.
3. Pull requests across all affected lessons, implementing the recommendations made in 2, above.
4. A blog post reporting on the activities and decisions of the task force.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- Chair, responsible for:
  - overall leadership of the task force and advancing its aims and objectives
  - organising and facilitating the task force meetings (e.g. preparing meeting agendas and details and distributing them to other committee members ahead of meetings)
  - keeping the task force documentation up to date
  - producing the final blog post
- Co-chair, responsible for:
  - stepping in for the chair and helping with other tasks when the chair is not available
- Member, responsible for:
  - Attending the task force meetings, participating in discussions and decisions of the task force, and contributing to the tasks
 
## Operational Procedures
Task force members will be appointed by invitation from the Director of Curriculum.
We aim for decisions to be made by [lazy consensus](https://medlabboulder.gitlab.io/democraticmediums/mediums/lazy_consensus/).
If the task force reaches an impasse and no consensus can be found, the chair may choose to allow decision-making by [majority vote](https://medlabboulder.gitlab.io/democraticmediums/mediums/majority_voting/) as a fallback.
If this fallback to majority is used, the method of decision-making and a record of how each member voted will be included in the meeting notes and final blog post.
