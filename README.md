# The Carpentries Task Forces

The Carpentries uses Task Forces to explore ideas and update policy, procedures, and guidelines. Task forces bring together a small group focused on a particular topic for a set period. Task forces are proposed by the community, Lesson Programs, Carpentries [Core Team](https://carpentries.org/team/), and governance. 

Each Task Force includes:

- A Task Force Charter that outlines the context, objectives, and deliverables of the Task Force
- A set timeline for the start and completion of the task force work
- An associated public-facing GitHub project for information about the Task Force during its work

A Task Force report is (optionally) shared with the Core Team upon completion of the work, and deliverables are developed and shared as outlined in the Task Force Charter.

[Task Force Charter template](task-force-charter-template.md)

The current mechanism for creating a Task Force is to identify needs for information gathering or updates in current policies, guidelines, or products and collaboratively draft a Charter with relevant community members. Community members interested in proposing or leading a Task Force should create an issue in this repository.

This repository is for our Task Force Charters and associated GitHub project boards.
